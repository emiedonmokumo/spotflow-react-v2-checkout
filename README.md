## Usage

Add Spotflow as a component or React Hook

This library can be implemented using the following

1. By Using the SpotflowButton component
2. By Using Hooks (preferred method)

### 1. Using the Payment CheckoutButton

```javascript

import React from "react";
import { SpotflowButton } from "@spot-flow/react-spotflow-checkout";

const PaymentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SpotflowButton
        amount={4000} // Not required for subscription payment
        currency="NGN"
        email="temi@mailinator.com" // Email of customer
        reference="MC-123456" // Not required, a unique payment reference will be generated if not provided
        name="John" // Name of customer: Not required
        phoneNumber="09090909090" // Phone number of customer: Not required
        encryptionKey="SKKXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        planId="9e0808304-344d-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX834034" // Not required for a one time payment
        merchantKey="sk_test_fXXXXedhXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        text="Pay Money"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

```

SpotflowButton has the ButtonProps which can allow you to customize to your design



### 2. Using Hooks

```javascript

import React from "react";
import { useSpotflowPayment } from "@spot-flow/react-spotflow-checkout";

const PaymentComponent = () => {
  const config = {
    amount: 4000, // Not required for subscription payment
    currency: "NGN",
    email: "temi@mailinator.com", // Email of customer
    name: "John", // Name of customer: Not required
    phoneNumber: "09090909090", // Phone number of customer: Not required
    reference: "MC-123456", // Not required, a unique payment reference will be generated if not provided
    merchantKey: "sk_test_fXXXXedhXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    planId: "9e0808304-344d-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX834034", // Not required for a one time payment
    encryptionKey:"SKKXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
  const initialFn = useSpotflowPayment();

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          initialFn(config);
